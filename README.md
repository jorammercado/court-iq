## üìä Project Overview

Court-IQ provides basketball fans and sports bettors with a central hub to explore NBA team rosters, player stats, real-time odds, and in-depth performance visualizations. Users can track player performance trends game-to-game through interactive D3.js area + line graphs, selecting specific stats such as points, assists, rebounds, minutes, and more, with zoomable ranges for granular analysis. The player page also includes six histogram charts visualizing stat distributions across games.

Features include player prop bets tied to specific matchups across various bookmakers, NBA team dashboards featuring roster stats and game history going back 5 seasons, and NBA conference standings with head-to-head team odds. Users can access actual bets by clicking the venture card in the standings page or the bookmaker name on the player props table in the team rosters page.

Additional features include a headlines page with real-time NBA news, a glossary of basketball terms, a player comparison tool, and WNBA standings with associated head-to-head odds.

## üí∏ Betting Overview

Court-IQ integrates real-time betting data from multiple sportsbooks into various areas of the platform, especially through **Player Prop Bets** and **Head-to-Head Team Odds**.

### What is a Player Prop Bet?

A "prop bet" (short for proposition bet) is a wager on a specific player‚Äôs in-game performance rather than the overall outcome of the match. For example, a bettor might wager on whether a player will score over or under a certain number of points in a game.

**Example Row from Court-IQ‚Äôs Props Table:**

```
Bookmaker: FanDuel  
Player: X Player  
Type: Over  
Value: 9.5  
Odds: 102  
Category: Points
```

* **Bookmaker**: Online betting platform (clickable link to place bet)
* **Type**: Whether the bet is on the player going **Over** or **Under** a stat threshold
* **Value**: The threshold number (e.g., 9.5 points)
* **Odds**: Payout odds from the sportsbook
* **Category**: Stat being wagered on (e.g., Points, Assists, etc.)

### How to Use Court-IQ to Evaluate Prop Bets

Clicking on a player card takes you to their player page, where you can:

* View a **line graph** tracking the player‚Äôs performance in the stat category across recent games
* Zoom into specific stretches (e.g., last 5 games)
* Compare the prop **threshold** (e.g., 9.5 points) to actual game-by-game outputs

This gives bettors **visual clarity** that traditional sites (like NBA.com or ESPN) often lack. Those sites may show averages, but Court-IQ shows **trends**, making it easier to spot hot/cold streaks or recent role changes.

### Why It Matters

Even a player averaging 10 PPG could have a volatile trend: maybe 18 points one night, 2 the next. Averages don‚Äôt tell the full story‚Äî**trends do**. Court-IQ empowers bettors with the tools to spot patterns visually and make smarter, more confident wagers.
