## 📊 Project Overview

## 💸 Betting Overview

Court-IQ integrates real-time betting data from multiple sportsbooks into various areas of the platform, especially through **Player Prop Bets** and **Head-to-Head Team Odds**.

### What is a Player Prop Bet?

A "prop bet" (short for proposition bet) is a wager on a specific player’s in-game performance rather than the overall outcome of the match. For example, a bettor might wager on whether a player will score over or under a certain number of points in a game.

**Example Row from Court-IQ’s Props Table:**

```
Bookmaker: FanDuel
Player: X Player
Type: Over
Value: 9.5
Odds: 102
Category: Points
```

- **Bookmaker**: Online betting platform (clickable link to place bet)
- **Type**: Whether the bet is on the player going **Over** or **Under** a stat threshold
- **Value**: The threshold number (e.g., 9.5 points)
- **Odds**: Payout odds from the sportsbook
- **Category**: Stat being wagered on (e.g., Points, Assists, etc.)

### How to Use Court-IQ to Evaluate Prop Bets

Clicking on a player card takes you to their player page, where you can:

- View a **line graph** tracking the player’s performance in the stat category across recent games
- Zoom into specific stretches (e.g., last 5 games)
- Compare the prop **threshold** (e.g., 9.5 points) to actual game-by-game outputs

This gives bettors **visual clarity** that traditional sites (like NBA.com or ESPN) often lack. Those sites may show averages, but Court-IQ shows **trends**, making it easier to spot hot/cold streaks or recent role changes.

### Why It Matters

Even a player averaging 10 PPG could have a volatile trend: maybe 18 points one night, 2 the next. Averages don’t tell the full story—**trends do**. Court-IQ empowers bettors with the tools to spot patterns visually and make smarter, more confident wagers.
